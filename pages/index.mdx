# Your Name

Hey, I'm a Principal Software Engineer in a US based health care technology company. 
I enjoy working as a web application developer and designing web based solutions.

This personal website is created to share my life philosophies and some practices I follow in my day to day life.

This portal is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). 
Thanks to [netlify](https://netlify.com/) for providing hosting support.
