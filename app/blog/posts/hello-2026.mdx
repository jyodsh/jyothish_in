## Hello 2026

Looking back, 2025 was a rollercoaster—emotionally exhausting, to say the least.  
I was on the verge of losing both my mind and body, and at times, I felt close to doing something extreme.

I am deeply thankful to my therapist, who patiently listened and extended a helping hand, guiding me back onto the right path.

That was the survival part of 2025. I hope the strength I gained last year continues to carry me through 2026.

This is my first blog post of 2026, and I'm looking forward to a more positive year.  
I also plan to write more here rather than posting on my Twitter account.

There are no new resolutions this year. Instead, I'm making changes in my life whenever I feel it's needed. I started writing and sketching again in 2025—perhaps “restarted” is the right word.

I've slowly built an Obsidian-based note-taking ecosystem that helps me keep my information compatible across devices and resilient to technology changes. I'd like to share more about this in the future, including how I use Markdown files for my notes and photo blogs.

Another important change is that I've started sketching a lot as part of my day-to-day work. This isn't about artwork—it's about sketching ideas, thoughts, and problems related to my work.

This gives me clarity and structure, which later helps me translate those ideas into documents more effectively.

There are a few things I'd like to do in 2026, mostly around learning and personal growth. I'll talk about them in future posts.
